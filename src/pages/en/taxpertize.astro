    question: "Which companies are affected by Pillar Two in Luxembourg?",
    answer: "Multinational groups with consolidated revenues ≥ €750M in at least 2 of the last 4 fiscal years. This includes Luxembourg Ultimate Parent Entities (UPE) and constituent entities in Luxembourg. Purely Luxembourg national groups may be affected through QDMTT (Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax). Possible exemptions: governmental entities, international organizations, non-profit entities, pension funds, investment fund-UPEs and their SPVs under conditions."
  },
  {
    question: "How to apply ATAD interest limitation rules in Luxembourg?",
    answer: "The limitation applies to exceeding borrowing costs above 30% of tax EBITDA or €3M (whichever is higher). Tax EBITDA = taxable income + exceeding borrowing costs + tax depreciation + specific adjustments. Exemptions: standalone entities, pre-17.06.2016 public loans, long-term infrastructure projects. Carry forward possible for non-deducted excess over 5 years and unused capacity over 5 years (under conditions)."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the SOPARFI participation exemption regime in Luxembourg?",
    answer: "Full exemption of dividends and capital gains on qualifying participations. Conditions: holding ≥ 10% or acquisition price ≥ €1.2M (dividends) or €6M (capital gains). Minimum duration: 12 uninterrupted months. The subsidiary must be a capital company resident in EU or tax treaty country, or non-resident company subject to tax ≥ 8.5%. Possible recapture of previous depreciation on disposal. Very attractive regime for holdings and European decision centers."
  },
  {
    question: "How to optimize economic substance in Luxembourg?",
    answer: "Substance requires: physical office in Luxembourg with dedicated address, active local bank account, locally maintained accounting, documented board meetings in Luxembourg, at least 1 qualified resident director, strategic decisions made and documented in Luxembourg. For active holdings: dedicated staff, effective management of participations, contemporaneous documentation of decisions. Substance protects access to tax treaties and EU directives, reduces risks of challenges by foreign tax authorities."
