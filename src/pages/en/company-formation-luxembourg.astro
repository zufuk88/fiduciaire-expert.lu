    question: "What is the difference between a SARL and a SARL-S in Luxembourg?",
    answer: "The SARL-S is reserved for natural persons, ideal for testing a project with capital from €1 to €12,000. Business license required before RCS registration. The classic SARL requires minimum €12,000 capital with prior deposit in blocked account and a notarial deed. For SARL, RCS registration is possible before obtaining the business license."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost to create a company in Luxembourg?",
    answer: "Company formation in Luxembourg starts from €1,000 excl. VAT for an SCI, €2,000 excl. VAT for a SARL-S, €3,500 excl. VAT for a SARL or SAS, and €4,000 excl. VAT for an SA. These rates include our fees, administrative costs and post-creation follow-up."
  },
  {
    question: "Is a notary mandatory to create a company?",
    answer: "No, not always. The SARL-S (reserved for natural persons) and certain SCIs can be created without a notary. However, for a classic SARL or SA, the notarial deed is mandatory under Luxembourg law."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I create a company in Luxembourg without residing there?",
    answer: "Yes, it is possible to create a company in Luxembourg without residing there. However, certain obligations apply: legal domiciliation in Luxembourg, appointment of a tax representative if necessary, and compliance with local accounting obligations."
