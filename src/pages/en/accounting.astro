  {
    question: "What are the mandatory accounting deadlines for Luxembourg companies?",
    answer: "Luxembourg companies must hold their Annual General Meeting within 6 months after year-end to approve accounts. Following approval, companies have 1 month to file with the RCS. For December year-ends, this means 31 July is the absolute deadline. Late filing incurs penalties starting at €50 and escalating to €500."
  },
  {
    question: "Which companies need to follow PCN 2020 standards?",
    answer: "All commercial companies including SA, SARL, SCA, and SE must follow PCN 2020 and use eCDF electronic filing. Sole proprietorships with turnover below €100,000 and civil companies may have simplified requirements. However, all entities must maintain sufficient accounting records for tax compliance."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know if my company needs a statutory audit?",
    answer: "Statutory audits are mandatory for medium and large companies. Your company needs an audit if it exceeds 2 of 3 thresholds for two consecutive years: €7.5M balance sheet, €15M turnover, or 50 employees for small companies. Small companies are generally exempt unless they are public interest entities."
  },
  {
    question: "What accounting software is recommended for Luxembourg compliance?",
    answer: "Professional accounting in Luxembourg typically uses Horus (AI-supported with full PCN 2020 integration), Bob 50 (advanced multi-entity management), or Odoo (cloud-based modular platform). All support the standardized chart of accounts, automated VAT calculations, and direct eCDF filing required by Luxembourg regulations."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I change accounting providers during the fiscal year?",
    answer: "Yes, you can change accounting providers at any time. The transition process involves transferring accounting records, ensuring continuity of bookkeeping, and coordinating with tax authorities if needed. Professional providers manage this transition seamlessly to avoid disruption to your operations or compliance obligations."
  },
  {
    question: "What documents do I need to provide to my accountant regularly?",
    answer: "Essential documents include bank statements, sales and purchase invoices, payroll records, expense receipts, and contracts affecting the company's finances. Digital document management systems facilitate efficient sharing and ensure all transactions are properly recorded and supported for audit purposes."
