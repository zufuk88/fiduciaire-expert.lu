  {
    question: "Which form and deadline for corporate tax returns in Luxembourg?",
    answer: "For capital companies (SA, Sàrl, Sàrl-S, SAS, SCA, SE), the unified return '500' must be filed online via MyGuichet.lu and covers CIT, MBT and NWT; forms 200 (joint income assessment) and 300 (commercial income and MBT) mainly target fiscally transparent entities and partnerships, with form 205 applying to specific cases (notably reverse hybrid entities); CIT/MBT returns for year N must be filed by 31 December of N+1, while NWT returns for year N are due by 31 December of N; the filing campaign opens in early April and runs until 31 December; LuxTrust or eID authentication is required for filing. Annual accounts must be attached if not filed with the RCS; in case of late filing of forms 500, 300 or 200, the tax authorities set penalties and may apply sanctions."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the VAT rates and VAT return deadlines in Luxembourg?",
    answer: "The standard VAT rate is 17%, with reduced rates of 14%, 8% and 3% depending on the nature of goods and services. Periodic returns (monthly or quarterly based on turnover) must be filed electronically via eCDF by the 15th of the month following the relevant period, but the tax authorities apply in practice an administrative tolerance of 2 months for periodic filings (tolerance not provided by law and revocable). The annual VAT return is due on 31 December of the year following the reporting period, except if the frequency is annual, in which case the deadline is 31 October. European Sales Lists (ESL) must be filed by the 25th of the month following the period; for services, frequency is optional (monthly or quarterly); for goods, it's monthly by default, with quarterly option only if the amount of intra-community supplies hasn't exceeded €50,000 in the current quarter and in each of the four previous quarters."
  },
  {
    question: "How to process salary withholding tax in Luxembourg? Deadlines and frequency?",
    answer: "Salary withholding tax is the tax withheld by the employer on employee remuneration. Since 1 January 2025, the 'Declaration of withholding tax on remuneration and tax credit bonuses' must be filed online via MyGuichet.lu using form 950 (LuxTrust/eID authentication), by the employer, pension fund or a representative. Declaration and payment are due within 10 days after the end of the period. Frequency depends on total monthly withholdings: monthly if ≥€750, quarterly if €75 to <€750, annual if <€75. Payment is made to the competent tax office mentioning the tax number, relevant period and declaration reference. Form 950 also covers tax credit bonuses (e.g. CIS, CISSM)."
  },
  {
    question: "How to optimize the tax burden in Luxembourg?",
    answer: "Tax optimization relies on appropriate legal structuring (Sàrl/SA, SOPARFI, SCS/SCSp), proper application of treaties to avoid double taxation, OECD-compliant transfer pricing policies (local/master file, potential APAs) and controlled use of special regimes (participation exemption, IP 'nexus' regime). This includes neutral reorganizations (contributions, mergers, splits), financing management and interest limitations, VAT optimization of flows and supply chain, international mobility of executives/employees, as well as planning for losses and credits utilization. Our tailored advice covers diagnosis, quantified scenarios, legal and accounting implementation, documentation and governance (substance, DAC6), with annual monitoring to maintain compliance and performance. Support by Taxpertize to provide answers to your questions."
